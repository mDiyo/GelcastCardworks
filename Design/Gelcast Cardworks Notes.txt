Tinker's Cardworks

- Description: Build a tool out of parts. These parts have four stats: speed, damage, durability, and style. 
-- Whoever makes the highest stat wins and the difference is deducted from the opponent's morale. Lose all twelve hearts of morale and you lose

Characters: AI, Player
- Players have 10 hearts of morale. If they lose all 10, they lose the game

Tool Stats: 
- Durablity (Green): The tool has X amount of durability. Durability is used up during tests
- Slots (Gray): Upgrades require these slots. One per upgrade
- Power (Red): Used for attack tests, bias towards power.
- Style (Blue): Used for contests, bias towards style.


[ Game Loop ]

Phase 1: Draw
- The player has two decks: Materials and Upgrades. They draw four cards from each deck per turn. No hand limit
- Two tests are also drawn from the deck. 
- Existing tools have durability repaired by 3

Phase 2: Build
- Tools are made out of two parts: Head, Handle. These determine primary stats and slots
- Tools can be modified with other cards. Any card on a tool can be replaced at any time
- Stat baseline: 4 durablity, 2 power, 2 style, 2 slots. 
- Tools are kept after each round. This does include durability... you can build more than one tool and decide which to use each round
- Parts and modifiers on tools can be replaced by discarding a card on them.
- Maximum of 3 tools per player

Phase 3: Test
- Test cards marked as contests pit the tool against the object. If power or style is lower than the amount listed on the card, the tool loses the difference in durability
- Test cards marked as duels pit the two tools against each other. The same difference as contests is applied, but the target is changed to your opponent
- If a tool reaches 0 durability, all cards it is built with are discarded

Phase 4: Evaluate
- The tool with the highest durability wins. The loser takes the difference between the two's durability
- If all tests have been removed through card effects both players lose 1 morale
- If either player reaches 0 morale, they lose
